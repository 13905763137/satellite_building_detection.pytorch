Use as small a network as possible at first. 
The current fasterrcnn_resnet18_fpn has 21M parameters.
Official resnet18 from PyTorch has 11M parameters, which should be a 
good guideline adjusting the number of model parameters.  

Try to overfit a small dataset first(one image), and observe train/val loss
and accuracy.
